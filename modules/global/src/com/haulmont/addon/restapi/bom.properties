# We explicitly duplicate spring security dependencies versions defined in the CUBA bom.properties, because these versions
# may be changed in CUBA bugfix releases, but REST API add-on releases depend on CUBA 7.2.0 and don't receive these versions
# updates. That's why we need to store explicit version numbers right in the REST API add-on sources in order to control
# dependencies.
